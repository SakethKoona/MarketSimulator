OrderBook Invariants
- OrderLookup_ is the complete source of truth for existence of orders and their location
  - if something doesn't exist in orderLookup_, then it doesn't exist in the book and vice versa
  - bestBid < bestAsk ALWAYS after any operation, otherwise a match can be made
  - Orders are unique and cannot exist in two places
  - Quantities and Prices can never be negative (they can be negative for keys stored in the skiplist, but
  for their actual values in the price levels, they can never be negative)
  - Book is always sorted, asks by ascending order, and bids by descending order
  - Orders are immutable except for decreasing quantity


PriceLevel Integrity:
- Pricelevel.totalQuantity() = sum(PriceLevel.orders.quantity)
- PriceLevel.Size() = len(PriceLevel.orders)


Next, we need to make these tests something more mechanical and directly testable, some are already there,
but others we can refine more.
