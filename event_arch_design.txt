Event Architecture
  - NOTE: ITCH has an order reference number, which I'm assuming is the OrderId, do we need to include that



- AddEvent: shows that an event was added to the orderbook
  - has price, qty, and side
  - market orders will never reach the orderbook so we dont have to worry about ordertype
  - since most of this will just be used for orderbook reconstruction by external clients anywayas,
    we won't have to worry about different times in force (or will we)


NOTE: Inside ITCH, this is just called a delete event
- CancelEvent: will just say that an order was removed or canceled from the orderbook
  - contains price, qty, and side
  - will occur when we remove an order from a price level AND deleted from the orderlookup within that book 


NOTE: Inside ITCH, this is called a partial cancel or CancelEvent
- ModifyEvent: will dispatch whenever an order within the orderbook is modified
  - contains the order_ref_number, oldqty (optional), newqty
  - In ITCH, they say that users will just be able to calculate the difference based on
  the reference number


- OrderExecuted: whenever an order within the book is executed in whole or part
  - this will be different from the modify event message because that happens when we deliberately cancel shares
  - this will incluyde:  order reference number, executed shares (oldqty - newqty), a match reference number generated by us

OPTIONAL: OrderExecutes with price different from display price
  - idk if our system even supports that operation currently


OrderReplace Message:
- this happens when an existing order within the orderbook has been canceled and then replaced
- basically one of the cases for our modify order, right
- contains:
  - old ref_number
  - new ref_number
  - qty
  - price


Trade Messages:

TradeEvent
 - This happens whenever a trade occurs with something not in the orderbook,
  - so stuff like modify orders, ioc, or incoming orders
